            <h1>What's it like being a Counselor?</h1>
            <p>
                It's a blast. You can have a lot of fun and its a great experience to grow as a leader. It is also very rewarding to help the campers grow in faith and have fun. 
                </p>
            <h1>So what do you do at Camp?</h1>
            <p>
                Everyone has a role. Every counselor can find their niche. Maybe you are great with physical activity and you can help with planning UTC. Otherwise you can lead Bible studies. Others are gifted musically and are great at helping with the daily music sessions!
            </p>
            <h1>How can I get involved?</h1>
            <p>

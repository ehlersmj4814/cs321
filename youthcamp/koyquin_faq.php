            <h3>
                <strong>Q:  Who will be supervising my child?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                A: Camp is headed up by directors Tom Naumann and Jessica Sydow. Both have been directing Camp Koyquin and Eau Claire, WI Youth Camp since 2009.

            <h3>
                <strong>Q:  What if my child becomes home sick?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                A: This can be common, especially during the first couple of days. We have a busy schedule planned for our campers to keep their mind off home. Our staff is great at interacting with the children and taking note of those who may be missing home. We will help your child in any way we can, and in the worst case scenario, make arrangements to help them get home if the week is too unbearable. We have a great group of returning campers who definitely help out with homesickness too!
            </p>

            <h3>
                <strong>Q:  Is my child ready for camp, or should I wait a year?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                A: Camp gives your child an opportunity to meet peers and role models with the same foundation in Christ. The friends your child will make and the things he/she will learn will aid in preparing him/her for challenges ahead in middle school, high school, friendships, etc. It is a unique opportunity for fellowship with others outside their school, home, and church environment. Only you as a parent can decide if your child is the right age, but we definitely encourage you to allow them to attend at this age (5th grade) has proven to be very appropriate in the past.
            </p>


            <h3>
                <strong>Q:  Who are the spiritual leaders?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                A: The morning chapels are conducted by former pastor Steve Sydow, a member of the CLC affiliated Messiah Lutheran Church in Eau Claire, WI. Rev. Sydow also puts together the curriculum for the religion classes for the week. The theme of camp will be based on Rev. Sydow's religion class topics. The religion classes are taught by CLC members many who are currently studying at Immanuel Lutheran College in Eau Claire, WI to be pastors and teachers.
            </p>

            <h3>
                <strong>Q:  Can I contact my child during the week?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                A: The best plan is to let them contact you. If you would like to send a cell phone with your child, that will be allowed, but your child will be required to check in their phone upon arrival to prevent damage and/or loss. Letters can be sent to the following address:
            </p>

                <strong>Q:  My child is shy, will he/she make friends?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                A: Absolutely! Your child will not be left alone to fend for themselves. The camp staff knows the majority of the returning campers which allows them to spend time getting to know the new campers and introducing them to others. We plan a busy schedule which includes active participation for all campers which makes it hard to be lonely and creates fun for everyone!
            </p>

            <h3>
                <strong>Q:  Is there more to camp than sports?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                A: Much more! The day starts with calisthenics, followed by chapel and Bible classes. Activity periods follow (sports, crafts, swimming etc.) with room for a couple of meals in between. Nightly activities include singing, free time and specially planned fun activities.

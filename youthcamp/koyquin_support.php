        <h3>Laurie Marzofka Fund</h3>
        <p>The name Laurie Marzofka holds a very special place in our hearts here at CLC Youth Camp. Laurie was a mentor to the previous directors of camp, and a blessing to everyone involved. Though she may be remembered for her greatly appreciated discussion groups with the older girls, or her hours spent behind the canteen counter, it is her embodiment of the idea of a Christian counselor that inspired this fund.</p>

        <p>The Laurie Marzofka Fund is dedicated to encouraging families to send their children to camp in providing financial aid when needed. (There is an option in camper registration to apply for financial aid.)</p>

        <p>As we do not have the fund set up through PayPal yet, we ask that you donate in the form of a check. The check will be made out to "CLC Youth Camp" with "Laurie Marzofka Fund" in the subject line. Checks can be sent to ILC (501 Grover Rd. Eau Claire, WI 54701). Jonathan Gamble will be the person addressed on the envelope.</p>

        <p>"But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for such is the kingdom of heaven." Matthew 19:14</p>

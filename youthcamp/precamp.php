        <h3>The Pre-Camper program</h3>
        <p>
            Offers the experiences of the original camper program for the, shall we say, less seasoned camper. Children entering kindergarten through 5th grade will have the opportunity to attend a half-day camp filled with Bible stories, crafts, sports, music, snacks and plenty of playtime! This program has been skillfully run by volunteers and is a great way to get kids ready for youth camp in their future years!
